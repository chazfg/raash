Just doing shell but with rust. An annoying, needless reimpl. Rust annoying ass shell. Raash. Uses pest to parse, rustyline to handle repl.


## Roadmap

- [x] Call simple commands from /usr/bin
- [x] Simple param sub
- [ ] Simple command sub
- [ ] Simple arithmetic sub
- [ ] Set/export env
- [ ] Load things from a .raash file
- [ ] I simply can't be arsed to think about what else this will entail
    - [ ] We will get there when we get there
